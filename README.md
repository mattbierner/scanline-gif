</div>

scanline.gif is an experiment flattening gifs so that multiple frames of the animation are rendered in a single image. The effect is kind of like [slit-scan photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit-scan_photography).

A few different preset mode are provided. [Check out the website to load your own gif and try playing around with the rendering settings](site).
